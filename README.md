 *Glossary of Variable Abbreviations in Python*

## Rules
Abbreviations should:
1. Whenever possible, be pronounceable as standalone words, rather than requiring the spelling of each letter.
2. Be used only for words with 5 or more letters.
3. Refer only to a single word, or at most, to words with the same root.
4. Whenever possible, not form an existing known word.
5. Not form a reserved word or, in most cases, a built-in function.

## Glossary
- abbrev = abbreviation
- addr = address
    - Pronounced as "adder".
- alt = alternative | alternate
- api = application programming interface
    - Exception to the rule because the initialism has become a word.
- app = application
- arg = argument
- asc = ascend(ing)
- attr = attribute
    - Pronunced as "atter".
- char = character
    - "ch" as in chuch, and "ar" as in car.
- comp_key = composite key
- conf = configuration
- const = constant
- curr = current
- dbase = database
    - Not db, because it's a spelling.
- defi = definition | define
    - Not def, because it's a reserved word.
- desc = descend(ing)
- descr = description
    - Pronounced as "desker"
- dest = destination
- dev = development | develop
- doc = document | documentation
- env = environment
- err = error
- esc = escape
- func = function
- gen = generate
- id = identifier
    - Exception to the rule, but still pronounceable.
    - Although 'id' is a built-in function, it's widely used as a variable.
- ima = image
    - Not img, because it's a spelling.
- imp = implementation | implement
- info = information
- inst = instance
- intro = introduction
- clas = class
    - Not cls, because it's a spelling.

- kwarg = keyword argument
    - Pronounced as "quarg".
- lang = language
- lib = library
- loc = location | locate
- mes = message
    - Not msg, because it's a spelling.
    - Not mess, because it has its own meaning.
- meta = metadata
- mod = module
- modi = modify
- num = number
- ob = object
    - Pronunced like in "job".
    - Not obj, because it's a spelling.

    - Pronounced as "OR-ig" (not "ij").
- param = parameter
- patt = pattern
- prev = previous
- prog = program
- proc = process

## Alternatives for Reserved Words
- false = False
- none = None
- true = True
- clas = class
- defi = def
- glob = global
- ret = return

## Alternatives for Built-in Functions
- id
    - No abbreviation. id should be used as "id" because it's already short and it's widely used, even though it's a built-in variable.
- lis = list
- tup = tuple
