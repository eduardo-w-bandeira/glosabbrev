 *Glossary of Variable Abbreviations in Python and Alternatives for Protected Names*

## Rules
Abbreviations should:
1. Whenever possible, be pronounceable as standalone words, rather than requiring the spelling of each letter.
2. Be used only for words with 6 or more letters.
3. Refer only to a single word, or at most, to words with the same root.
4. Whenever possible, not form an existing known word.
5. Not form a reserved word or, in most cases, a built-in function.

# Glossary
- abbrev = abbreviation
- absol = absolute
- addr = address
    - Pronounced as "adder".
- alt = alternative | alternate
- api = application programming interface
    - Exception to the rule because the initialism has become a word.
- app = application
- arg = argument
- asc = ascend(ing)
- attr = attribute
    - Pronunced as "atter".
- char = character
    - "ch" as in chuch, and "ar" as in car.
- comp = component
- conf = configuration
- const = constant
- cont = content
- curr = current
- dbase = database
    - Not db, because it's a spelling.
- decor = decorator
- defi = definition | define
    - Not def, because it's a reserved word.
- desc = descend(ing)
- descr = description
    - Pronounced as "desker"
- dest = destination
- dev = development | develop
- doc = document | documentation
- env = environment
- err = error
- esc = escape
- func = function
- gen = generate
- id = identifier
    - Exception to the no-spelling rule, but still pronounceable.
    - Exception to the no-built-in function, because it's widely used as a class-variable.
- ima = image
    - Not img, because it's a spelling.
- imp = implementation | implement
- info = information
- inst = instance
- intro = introduction
- kwarg = keyword argument
    - Pronounced as "quarg".
- lang = language
- lib = library
- loc = location | locate
- memo = memory
- meta = metadata
- mod = module
- modi = modify
- num = number
- ob = object
    - Pronunced like in "job".
    - Not obj, because it's a spelling.
- oper = operation | operate
- orig = original | origin
    - Pronounced as "OR-ig" (not "ij").
- param = parameter
- patt = pattern
- prev = previous
- prog = program
- proc = process
- prod = production
- prop = property
- prot = protocol
- proto = prototype
- ref = reference
- req = request
- resp = response
- sec = second
- spec = specification
- stat = status

# Alternatives for Reserved Words
- false <=> False
- none <=> None
- true <=> True
- klass <=> class
    - Not cls, because it's a spelling.
- defi <=> def
- glob <=> global
- ret <=> return

# Alternatives for Built-in Functions
- id
    - No abbreviation. id should be used as "id" because it's already short and it's widely used, even though it's a built-in variable.
- lis <=> list
- ob <=> object
- tup <=> tuple
- prop <=> property
